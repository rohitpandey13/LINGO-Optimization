# Optimize Water Utility Depot Location
The aim is to identify the optimal water utility depot location to service the maintenance jobs whilst minimizing travel times.

Travel for all jobs starts at a depot and end at the job location

The number of jobs in each location are the total number of jobs occurred in the location in 2019

This model was built in LINGO (an Optimization software) while reading inputs and outputs results to excel

User can nominate the number of depot to be established. The model should then consider depot numbers and 
identify their optimal location to minimize travel time to jobs from these depots.

Guide to use the model:	
1. Open both excel and LINGO model (DepotLocationPlay.lg4)	
2. Go to "Data" tab, nominate the number of depots to be established (yellow cell)	
3. Run the LINGO model by clicking the bullseye button	
4. Results will be shown in the "Available Depots" column	A
